Used pretrained MobileNet V2 to classify between 10 classes of distracted driver which include talking on the phone, texting, talking to passenger, hair and makeup, etc. The MobileNet was pretrained on ImageNet, used transfer learning to train the model to predict the classes. Also trained a VGG 16 model to analyze and compare the results of the two models.
